# ESP Teacher Setup Instructions

## How ESP Teachers See Their Assigned Cases

ESP teachers will only see VPF cases that have been specifically assigned to them by guidance counselors.

### Setup Process:

1. **Create ESP Teacher User Account**
   - Username: `esp_teacher`
   - Password: `esp123`
   - Name: Maria Garcia
   - Role: ESP Teacher/VPF Coordinator

2. **Add Matching Entry in "Manage ESP Teacher/VPF"**
   - Go to: Counselor Dashboard → Manage ESP Teacher/VPF
   - Add a teacher with name: **Maria Garcia** (must match the user account name)
   - This creates the link between the user account and the VPF teacher

3. **Assign Cases to ESP Teacher**
   - Go to: For VPF → Click "Assign Teacher"
   - Select: Maria Garcia from the dropdown
   - This assigns the case to that ESP teacher

4. **ESP Teacher Logs In**
   - Login as: `esp_teacher` / `esp123`
   - Navigate to: VPF Cases
   - Will see: Only cases assigned to "Maria Garcia"

### Important Notes:

- The ESP teacher's **full name** in their user account must match (or be similar to) the **name** in "Manage ESP Teacher/VPF"
- The system uses name matching to link user accounts to VPF teacher assignments
- If names don't match, the ESP teacher won't see any cases

### Current Setup:

**User Account:**
- Name: Maria Garcia
- Username: esp_teacher

**Manage ESP Teacher/VPF Entry Needed:**
- Name: Maria Garcia (or similar)
- Status: Active

Once both are set up and a case is assigned to "Maria Garcia", the esp_teacher account will see it!
