HOW TO ADD YOUR SCHOOL BUILDING IMAGE
======================================

1. Save the Don Serrat Lopez Memorial High School image as:
   school-building.jpg

2. Place it in this folder:
   C:\Users\lenovo\Downloads\sirms\static\images\school-building.jpg

3. The image should be:
   - Format: JPG, PNG, or WebP
   - Recommended size: 1920x1080 or higher
   - File name: school-building.jpg (exactly)

4. After adding the image:
   - Refresh your browser (Ctrl + F5)
   - The school building will appear as the hero background

CURRENT STATUS:
- Folder: Ready ✓
- Image: Missing (using gradient fallback)
- Page: Working with beautiful gradient background

The home page will work perfectly with the gradient background.
Once you add the school image, it will blend beautifully with the gradient overlay!
