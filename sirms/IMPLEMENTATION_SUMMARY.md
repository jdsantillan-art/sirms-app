- Feature 2: DO Evaluation ✓

### Phase 3 (Large Refactor):

## Implementation Strategy

I'll create the core functionality for Features 1-3 now, and provide:
1. Working code for immediate use
2. Detailed documentation for Feature 4 (terminology change)
3. Migration scripts if needed
4. Testing checklist

Would you like me to:
A) Implement all features now (will take time)
B) Implement Features 1-3 now, provide guide for Feature 4
C) Focus on specific feature first

Please confirm and I'll proceed with the implementation.
