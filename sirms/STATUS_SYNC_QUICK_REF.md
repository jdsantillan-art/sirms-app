## How It Works

### 1️⃣ When You Create a Schedule

```
You: Click "Schedule Appointment" → Fill form → Submit
System: ✅ Creates schedule
        ✅ Updates status to "Scheduled" automatically
        ✅ Sends notifications to everyone
```

**Status Change:** `Classified` → `Under Review` (Scheduled)

### 2️⃣ When You Complete a Schedule

```
You: Click "Mark as Complete" → Confirm
System: ✅ Marks schedule complete
        ✅ Updates status to "Resolved" automatically
        ✅ Sends completion notifications
```

**Status Change:** `Under Review` → `Resolved` (Completed)
